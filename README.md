# Natours

Natours is an app for fictional company (that offers tours in the nature) I built in Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course Advanced CSS and Sass: Take your CSS to the next level. 

During this project I learned a ton of new CSS features (modern cutting-edge CSS techniques), built amazing CSS animations effects (using @keyframes, animation and transition), implemented the 7-1 CSS Architecture with the BEM methodology and Sass, and used responsive images for faster pageloads.
